> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Apple platforms (iOS, Mac Catalyst) the Uno storage extension, used by the authentication extension, use the OS Key Chain service to store secrets. This requires your application to have the [proper entitlements](xref:Uno.Extensions.Storage.HowToRequiredEntitlements) to work properly.
